- 👋 Hi, I’m @audhkhasi, PhD in Marine Geosciences from IPG, Paris.
- 👀 I’m interested mostly in high-resolution imaging and tomography of seismic data applied to crustal/lithospheric scales.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning tools and techniques so any feedback is most welcome.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything from seismological to near-surface engineering related aplications using seismic data.
- 📫 How to reach me pranavaudhkhasi@gmail.com
